## Introduction to Replit[](#introduction-to-replit "Direct link to heading")

[Replit](https://replit.com/) is a coding platform that lets you write code and host apps. It also has many educational features built-in, making it great for teachers and learners too. Every repl you create is a fully functional development and production environment. [Hosting from your editor](https://amasad.me/hosting) makes it easy to iterate quickly on your work, collaborate with others, and get feedback.

[Replit added Solidity](https://blog.replit.com/solidity) to its available programming languages, giving all of the features and functionality Replit provides to Web3 developers creating smart contracts. In this guide, you’ll learn how to make use of these features to build and deploy a smart contract on Celo.

tip

To learn more about the features available to you as a smart contract developer with Replit, visit the [Replit documentation](https://docs.replit.com/).

## Prerequisites[](#prerequisites "Direct link to heading")

To deploy on Celo using Replit, you don’t need any local environment. You should have a wallet available with testnet funds so that you can deploy and test transactions.

* [Set up a Development Test Wallet](/developer/setup/wallet)
* [Create a Replit account](https://replit.com/~)

If you are new to Replit, it will also help to review the [Solidity announcement](https://blog.replit.com/solidity) and [Replit documentation](https://docs.replit.com/).

## Create a Repl[](#create-a-repl "Direct link to heading")

After creating your Replit account, your home screen will include a dashboard where you can view projects, create projects, manage your account, and do many other things. You can get started by creating a new Repl.

* Choose + **Create Repl** from the left panel or + in the top right corner of the screen
* Select the **Solidity starter (beta)** template and give your project a title
* Click + **Create Repl** to create your project

## Explore the Workspace[](#explore-the-workspace "Direct link to heading")

By creating a project, you now have a fully functional online IDE that allows you to edit, view, and deploy your smart contracts. It also creates a front-end for your smart contract that you can publish to an easily sharable URL. Read [Solidity on Replit](https://blog.replit.com/solidity) for an overview of some of these features.

tip

The README provides an overview of the workspace and gives details on how to make the most of your Replit experience. Read this to help get more familiar with your workspace.

## Deploy on Celo[](#deploy-on-celo "Direct link to heading")

Deploying on Celo with Replit is easy. If you don’t have a wallet with funds, complete [Set up a Development Test Wallet](/developer/setup/wallet) so that you are prepared to deploy and interact with your smart contract.

* Select **Run** to install all relevant packages, start up the contract deployment UI, and compile your **contract.sol** file

![compile](/images/image3-8cd221a39fe1ae7ac5268724d9cb69d8.png)

* Select **Connect wallet**, select your account, then choose **Connect**.

![connect](/images/image4-45ce3f0dce8e77750470e2601109e61c.png)

* Select the contract you would like to deploy from the dropdown (ex. MathTest, SimpleStorage).
* To deploy this contract, select **Deploy** and confirm the transaction from your wallet.

You can now interact with your contract using the provided user interface or from a sharable URL shown on the interface.

## Verify Contract Deployment[](#verify-contract-deployment "Direct link to heading")

To view your deployed contract, copy your **account address** navigate to the [Celo explorer](https://explorer.celo.org/), and search for your account (verify that you are searching the correct network).

* View the most recently deployed contract to find additional information on your deployment.

## Update your dApp[](#update-your-dapp "Direct link to heading")

Your dApp is now live and can be shared with the world. You can use this workspace to edit and redeploy your dApp at any time. Here are a few tips you can use to help improve your dApp.

**Front-end updates**

Using **tools > ui.jsx** you can make changes to the front end of your dApp. To start, you can update the on-screen text from **Ethereum** to **Celo** and **ETH** to **CELO**.

* Use the files panel to navigate to **tools > ui.jsx**.

![ui](/images/image7-8d5bee436565bda53e5371d47193cc01.png)

* Update **Replit & Ethereum** to read **Replit & Celo** on (will be around lines 446 and 528).
* Update **ETH** to **CELO** next to the wallet address (will be around line 701).

![ui updates](/images/image8-9c1b32a85bd49b6415cbd22facbfadb6.png)

After making these basic changes, users will be able to determine that they are interacting with a Celo dApp. They can use the sharable URL to visit your dApp and make transactions from their wallet.

* Select **Version Control** from the left panel and click **Connect to GitHub**.

![connect to github](/images/image9-f2071f99181a0101a6448f63d77d87af.png)

* Name your GitHub Repo, select your preferences, and click **Create GitHub repository**.
* After your GitHub Repo is created, click the Repo link to go to your new repository.

![github](/images/image10-7aeeccd1b03c73d4129883b113e770a4.png)

You can now manage any additional changes using GitHub from the user interface provided by Replit.

## Publish to Replit[](#publish-to-replit "Direct link to heading")

Among many other features, Replit allows you to publish your projects to a personal profile. After publishing, projects will show up on your spotlight page for others to explore, interact with, clone, and collaborate.

* Select the **project title** at the top of the screen.
* Complete your project name and description and click **Publish**.

![publish](/images/image11-94e8e77803409de1ecdb33fa21c8da7c.png)

* Add a cover image, tags (try a **Celo** tag), and additional details for your project.

![cover image](/images/image12-2d119ab77c3b416ef9161e1fe7dad851.png)

* After publishing, navigate to the **Spotlight page** to view your project.

Your project is now available for other developers to view, share, fork, and comment on.
