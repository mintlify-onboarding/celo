## Account[](#account "Direct link to heading")

Identifies an account on Celo. There are two types of account. **Externally owned accounts** have an associated [CELO](#celo-native-asset) balance and are controlled by a user holding the associated public-private keypair. **Contract accounts** contain the code and data of a single smart contract which can be called and manipulate its own stored data.

## Address[](#address "Direct link to heading")

A unique identifier for an account on the Celo blockchain.

## Alfajores[](#alfajores "Direct link to heading")

The first public Celo test network, available for developers to use freely subject to the [Alfajores Testnet Disclaimer](/network/alfajores/disclaimer).

## Attestation[](#attestation "Direct link to heading")

Generally, support for an entity having an associated identity. In Celo, each attestation confirms that an account has access to a message sent to a specific mobile phone number via a specific validator via Celo's decentralized verification process.

## Attestation Service[](#attestation-service "Direct link to heading")

A service operated by validators that sends signed SMS messages in order to allow accounts to prove they have access to a phone number.

## Baklava[](#baklava "Direct link to heading")

## Block[](#block "Direct link to heading")

The unit of update to the blockchain. A block consists of a header identifying its position in the chain and other metadata, and a body that contains a list of transactions, and data structures that describe the new state after executing those transactions.

## Blockchain[](#blockchain "Direct link to heading")

A database maintained by a distributed set of computers that do not share a trust relationship or common ownership. This arrangement is referred to as decentralized. The content of a blockchain's database, or ledger, is authenticated using cryptographic techniques, preventing its contents being added to, edited or removed except according to a protocol operated by the network as a whole.

## Gas Price[](#gas-price "Direct link to heading")

Determines the unit price for gas, i.e. cost for a transaction to perform one step of execution. This is used to prioritize which transactions the network applies.

## Gas Price Minimum[](#gas-price-minimum "Direct link to heading")

The minimum unit price for gas that the Celo protocol will accept. This value changes from block to block in response to congestion, increasing as more transactions are competing for the limited capacity of the network. A transaction specifying a gas price below the Gas Price Minimum will not be processed until the Gas Price Minimum falls.

## Genesis block[](#genesis-block "Direct link to heading")

The very first block in the blockchain, provided as configuration to Celo Blockchain nodes.

## Geth[](#geth "Direct link to heading")

[go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), a Golang implementation of the Ethereum protocol from which the Celo Blockchain software is forked.

The Community Fund is maintained by a transfer made as part of Epoch Rewards, and is intended to cover costs beyond the other specific incentives provided to validators and validator groups. Awards can be made through an on-chain governance proposal.

## Istanbul[](#istanbul "Direct link to heading")

Istanbul, or IBFT, is the original name of the implementation of the Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm used by Celo. Istanbul is also the name of a hard fork of the Ethereum network.

## Light Client[](#light-client "Direct link to heading")

An interaction that takes place solely through a transaction being executed on the blockchain and updating the state of the ledger.

## Proof-of-Stake[](#proof-of-stake "Direct link to heading")

The system that determines the participants in a Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism. Celo's Proof-of-Stake mechanism permits accounts to convert units of [CELO](#celo-native-asset) into [Locked Gold](#locked-gold) then vote for Validator Groups, such that an election held at the end of every epoch selects a new set of validators for the following epoch.

## RC1[](#rc1 "Direct link to heading")

RC1, which stands for Release Candidate 1, was the first network that had the potential to become the Celo mainnet. It was promoted to Mainnet after the Celo community voted to enable [CELO](#celo-native-asset) transfers on the network on May 18, 2020.

## Validator Group[](#validator-group "Direct link to heading")

The entity in the proof-of-stake mechanism that can associate validators, receive votes from holders of [Locked Gold](#locked-gold) and cause those validators to be elected.

## Validator Set[](#validator-set "Direct link to heading")

The set of elected validators (with respect to a specific epoch) that participate in consensus

## Wallet[](#wallet "Direct link to heading")
