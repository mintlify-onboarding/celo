## Introduction to Remix[](#introduction-to-remix "Direct link to heading")

The [Remix IDE](https://remix-project.org/) is an open-source web and desktop application for creating and deploying Smart Contracts. Originally created for Ethereum, it fosters a fast development cycle and has a rich set of plugins with intuitive GUIs. Remix is used for the entire journey of contract development and is a playground for learning and teaching Celo.

In this guide, you will learn to deploy a smart contract on Celo using [remix.ethereum.org](http://remix.ethereum.org).

<Tip>To learn more about the features available to you as a smart contract developer with Remix, visit the [Remix documentation](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).</Tip>

## Create a Smart Contract[](#create-a-smart-contract "Direct link to heading")

* Navigate to [remix.ethereum.org](http://remix.ethereum.org) and select **contracts > 1\_Storage.sol** from the **File Explorers** pane.
* Review the smart contract code and learn more using the [Solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/) or with [Solidity by Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/).
* Complete any changes to your smart contract and save the final version (Command/Ctrl + S).

## Compile the Contract[](#compile-the-contract "Direct link to heading")

* Choose the **Solidity Compiler Icon** on the left side menu.
* Check that your compiler version is within the versions specified in the **pragma solidity statement**.
* Select the **Compile** button to compile your smart contract.

## Deploy the Contract[](#deploy-the-contract "Direct link to heading")

* Click the **Deploy and Run Transactions Icon** on the left side menu.
* Choose **Injected Web3** as your environment.
* [Connect MetaMask to Celo](/wallet/metamask/use) testnet and verify that the environment reads:  
   * **Custom (44787) network** for Celo testnet  
   * **Custom (42220) network** for Celo mainnet
* Click **Deploy** and select **Confirm** in the MetaMask notification window to pay for the transaction

## Interacting with the Contract[](#interacting-with-the-contract "Direct link to heading")

* Select the **dropdown** on the newly deployed contract at the bottom of the left panel.
* View the deployed contract’s functions using the **Deployed Contracts** window.
* Select functions to read or write on the Celo testnet using the function inputs as needed.
* Confirm write transactions in the **MetaMask Notification Window** to pay the transaction’s gas fee.

## View Contract Details[](#view-contract-details "Direct link to heading")

* Copy the contract address from the **Deployed Contracts** window on the left panel.
* Navigate to the [Celo Block Explorer](https://explorer.celo.org/) and use the contract address to search for your contract.
* Explore the details of your deployed smart contract and learn more about the explorer [here](http://docs.blockscout.com).
